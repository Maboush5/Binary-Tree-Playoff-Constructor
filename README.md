# Binary-Tree-Playoff-Constructor
In this assignment, we are building a binary tree to represent the playoff structure from this year's NHL playoffs. The root of the tree will contain the team who won the Stanley Cup, and the other series from the playoffs will be represented in the various nodes below, each rounds being represented as a level of the tree. As you might begin to envision, we have to build the tree from the bottom up rather than the top down. We will still have a tree with a root at the top and the leaf (pun not intended) nodes at the bottom, but we have to leave the upper nodes empty initially and then later fill them in once the series from the lower layers are completed.
